## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Objectives
- Analyze medical supply usage trends
- Identify understocked and high-cost items
- Support data-driven inventory decisions

## Use Case
This analysis can support hospital operations, supply chain teams, and healthcare administrators in optimizing inventory management.
